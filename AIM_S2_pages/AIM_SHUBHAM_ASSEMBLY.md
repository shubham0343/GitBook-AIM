# Introduction
 
This is the draft online guide for MR-B3RB-M Pre-Production version. Please excuse our "dust" while this gitbook is under construction. Supportive feedback is welcome: [iain.galloway@nxp.com](mailto:iain.galloway@nxp.com)
 
You can expect frequent updates as the pre-production units become closer to production. We will try to address any questions about assembly here. Check back often.
 
Also, take a look at some of our other GitBooks:
- **NXP Mobile Robotics**: Quick reference and index for all our mobile robotics solutions.
- **MR-B3RB**: NXP Buggy3 Rev B platform using NavQPlus and MR-CANHUBK344
- **HoverGames**: Drone & rover dev. kits, with FMUK66 vehicle management unit.
- **NXP Cup**: Autonomous model car competition for students.
- **MR-CANHUBK344**: Small form factor CAN-FD to 100BASE-T1 ethernet bridge.
- **UCANS32K146**: CAN-FD node for mobile robotics applications.
- **RDDRONE-BMS772**: Battery management system (3-6 cells).
- **RDDRONE-T1ADAPT**: 100BASE-T1 ethernet adapter.
 
## Pre-Production MR-B3RB-M Block Diagram
 
### MR-B3RB System block diagram
 
### Block Diagram: Power Distribution
 
The PDB (Power Distribution board) is primarily a connector board and allows things like the specialized connectors on the motor and encoder to translate to the Dupont-style or standard DroneCode connector pinouts. It should be noted that the block diagram above does not show the power distribution connections, which are as follows:
- Battery input through a fuse
- Battery voltage and current measurement through the INA226
- 3x Battery voltage outputs on 5 pin JST-GH for NavQPlus, MR-CANHUBK344, Extra 5V regulating supply for LED lights, and powering PWM servo rail on MR-CANHUBK344 and therefore the Servo itself.
 
### Block Diagram: GPS Module
 
The GPS combines UART, I2C for Compass, and GPIO for switches, LED, and Beeper into a single large DroneCode standard connector.
 
### Block Diagram: Debugging interfaces
 
The DCD-LZ interface simply combines SWD and a UART on a single JST-GH Dronecode connector. Depending on your kit you may have any of the following debug adapter boards:
- FTDI USB-UART cable and adapter for UART/Console on the NavQPlus
- FTDI USB-UART cable + DCD-LZ adapter for MR-CANHUBK344 DCD-LZ interface
- NeuralProbe board with USBC interface and connectors for UART/Console AND DCD-LZ interface. This board includes a USB-UART converter and also includes a button that will toggle the RST pin on SWD/JTAG interface. There is a 3rd interface on this board for Pixhawk V6X debug+uart connectors (not used here, used with NXP MR-VMU-RT1176)

# What's in the Box
 
These pages are for REFERENCE; use the BUILD guide for actual assembly. Because the MR-B3RB is a "kit of kits," we will show what components are in the box, grouped with the sub-kit that it relates to. These sub-pages will describe the individual sub-kit. Each page contains a components table which enumerates all the parts that are included in the kit. The diagrams on the pages contain the pictures of the parts. The parts are labelled with their corresponding serial numbers, either directly in the diagram or in the heading of the diagram. To understand the possible configurations, please refer to the Naming and Versions page.
 
## WITB Cables and Screws
 
Because this is the pre-production version of the MR-B3RB, some cables and screws are not as clearly separated in the sub-kits as they could be. For clarity, we will mention them and their purpose here.
 
### Cables and Screws Components
 
The wires represented by rows with serial numbers 6 and 7 in the following table are not included in the current (Pre-Production) unit. Refer to the Errata on the Pre-Production unit. In their place, incompatible cables are included and their pictures are shown in the diagrams on this page for reference purposes.
